# bubbles-turtles-and-alligators
Simulates the population of bubbles, turtles, and alligators.
The up arrow adds a bubble; the down arrow removes one.
The right arrow adds a turtle; the left arrow removes one.
The "a" key adds an alligator; the "d" key removes one.
The "s" key restarts the simulaton.
The number of points increases when an alligator pops a bubble, an alligator eats a turtle, or a turtle pops a bubble.
When the number of points overshoots 3000 (if that ever happens), the number of points will be reset to 0. (The points are in the console.)
